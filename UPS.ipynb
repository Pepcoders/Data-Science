wonder then, that the first thing most of us like to see when we pickup a newspaper is the cartoon. \n","    Simple though it may seem, making a cartoon is an art that requires a combination of hard work, training and a good sense of humour. \n","    Cartoonists say that the cartoons that make us laugh the most are in fact the cartoons that are hardest to make. \n","    Even celebrated cartoonists like R.K.Laxman admit that making a cartoon is not a piece of cake. \n","    Laxman says he has to wait for over six hours, which includes spending a lot of time scanning newspapers and television channels before any idea strikes him.\n","So how does one become a cartoonist? Which of us has the talent to make it? How can we master the rib-tickling strokes and the witty one-liners? How can we make people smile or laugh? \n","There are few colleges or schools for cartoonists. Most cartoonists come from art colleges, while some learn the craft on their own. \n","Most established cartoonists are of the view that no institute can teach you to make a cartoon. \n","“You can pick up the craft, you may learn to sketch and draw in institutes, but no one can teach anyone how to make a good cartoon,” says Uday Shanker, a cartoonist with Navbharat Times.\n","While basics, like drawing and sketching can be learnt in an art college, and are important skills, these alone, do not make a good cartoonist. \n"," Because it’s a question of one’s creativity and sense of humour; two qualities one simply may not have.
